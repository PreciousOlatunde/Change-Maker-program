# Change-Maker-program
The ChangeMaker program calculates the change after a purchase has been made and then expresses that change in the form of the specific bills and coins needed.

How to execute the program:
1. After running, the program prompts the user for the price of the item being bought in the transaction
2. Then the program prompts the user for the cash amount being paid by the buyer
3. The program then displays the change and the amount of each currency denomination needed to make that change
